# Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Data Analytics)
## Programming for Data Analysis (COMP08050) - Project 2020
The aim of this module is to develop programming skills towards the effective use of data analysis libraries and software.
Students learn how to select efficient data structures for numerical programming, and to use these data structures to transform
data into useful and actionable information.

If you have any issues viewing tasks2020.ipynb in github you can use Jupyter NBViewer which is a web application behind The Jupyter Notebook Viewer at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

### 2. Software used

![logo](https://github.com/Munster2020/HDIP_CSDA_COMP08050_PROJECT/blob/main/images/JupyterN.png "Jupyter")
![Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Jupyter is a free, open-source, interactive web tool known as a computational notebook, which researchers can use to combine software code, computational output, explanatory text and multimedia resources in a single document. (Source:downloads.com)

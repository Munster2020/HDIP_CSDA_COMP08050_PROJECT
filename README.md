# Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Data Analytics)
## Programming for Data Analysis (COMP08050) - Project 2020
The aim of this module is to develop programming skills towards the effective use of data analysis libraries and software.
Students learn how to select efficient data structures for numerical programming, and to use these data structures to transform
data into useful and actionable information.

If you have any issues viewing tasks2020.ipynb in github you can use Jupyter NBViewer which is a web application behind The Jupyter Notebook Viewer at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

### 2. Software used

![logo](https://github.com/Munster2020/HDIP_CSDA_COMP08050_PROJECT/blob/main/images/JupyterN.png "Jupyter")
![Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Jupyter is a free, open-source, interactive web tool known as a computational notebook, which researchers can use to combine software code, computational output, explanatory text and multimedia resources in a single document. (Source:downloads.com)

![Cmdr](https://cmder.net/) provides you with an alternative to the Windows default command prompt utility through a more capable console emulator that also comes packing a good-looking graphical user interface. (Source:downloads.com)

### 3. Project

__Problem statement__: For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon ofyour choosing.  You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that isof interest to you in your personal or professional life.  Then, rather than collect datarelated to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.We suggest you use thenumpy.randompackage for this purpose.Specifically, in this project you should:

- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.

- Investigate  the  types  of  variables  involved,  their  likely  distributions,  and  their relationships with each other.

- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.

- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.


Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set.  Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files.  It is okay to base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do),but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set.



__Learnings__: From working on this task I developed my knowledge of functions and how to implement them. In order to solve the task the function created and implemented a for loop and populated a dictionary to capture the results. I also gained a better understanding of "argument specifiers". Further detail and references are included in the Jupyter Notebook. I also learned to download and add additional functionality in Jupyter Notebooks, including using the add-ons "Autopep8", "spellchecker" and "Table of Contents(2)". Autopep8 is excellent for formatting your code correctly, while spellchecker comes in handy in correcting those pesky spelling mistakes.

__Topics__: functions, for loops, dictionaries, lists, argument specifiers.
